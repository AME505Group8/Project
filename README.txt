Project_Main.py is now the wrapper file that holds all of the variables for Project_Main, DataFrame_Loader, and Query_Database

The 'BIRD_STRIKE.pkl','BIRD_STRIKE_NUM_ONLY.pkl','BIRD_STRIKE_DICTIONARY.pkl' files are on the Google Drive, that needs to be downloaded and placed in your directory that you plan on running Project_Main and DataFrame_Loader.

Project_Main.py should run straight from GitHub without any modification assuming that BIRD_STRIKE.pkl, BIRD_STRIKE_NUM_ONLY.pkl, BIRD_STRIKE_DICTIONARY.pkl are in the correct folder.

Project_Main.py can run Query_Database but that is not necessary at this time.

DataFrame_Loader.py holds all of the functions

Project_Main.py should run straight from GitHub without any modification assuming that BIRD_STRIKE.pkl is in the correct folder.

For the report, Project_Main.py will also be able to run Query_Database but that is not necessary at this time.

The DataFrame_Loader.py is now a function file, it holds the function dataframe_loader and handle_non_numerical_data
The second function is from the TA that was modified slightly in order to make it work for this data set
